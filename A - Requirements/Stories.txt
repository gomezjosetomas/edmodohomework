Goal: Design a homework submission web application

Pick your favorite web framework to create this application. You are not required to create registration workflow and you can create the users in the database.
To simplify authentication, the user can log in with only the username (i.e. no password).

Please implement the following user stories:
1. Homework contains a title, a question and a due date. You do not need to create the UI for homework creation.
2. Teacher can assign a homework to multiple students. You do not need to create the UI for this.
3. Student can see all assigned homework. UI is required.
4. Student can submit a homework multiple times before the due date. UI is required.
5. Teacher can see a list of latest submissions for a homework. UI is required.
6. Teacher can see all submission versions for a student for a homework.UI is required.

If you are using Ruby on Rails, a barebone application containing the authentication system has been provided to you at https://github.com/edmodo/interview_homework

Sample mocks are included but feel free to design your UI.
